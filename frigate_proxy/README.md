# Home Assistant Add-on: Frigate Proxy

![Supports aarch64 Architecture][aarch64-shield] ![Supports amd64 Architecture][amd64-shield] ![Supports armv7 Architecture][armv7-shield]

This addon creates a proxy to a Frigate server run separately from Home Assistant so that you can have the benefit of access in the sidebar without running Frigate as an addon.

Note that this addon does not run Frigate itself.
